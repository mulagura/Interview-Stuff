• I always adhere to most of commitments/deliverables, but some couldn't because cooperation from other team,
• I always try to put in my innovativeness / make it reusable whatever the task being given, but there were situations where it is time bound which impacted expected result.
• Sometimes I lack in proper collaboration among team, because I always felt individuality should be maintained, peeking in other work would create chaos.
• I think planning should be in more efficient way, there is a great saying by Abraham lincoln,  If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I’d spend the first six of them sharpening my axe.
